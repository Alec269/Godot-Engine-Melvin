## üìã Overview

- ‚úÖ **Line Ending Preservation**: Projects maintain CRLF endings during runtime
- ‚úÖ **External Editor Support**: Works seamlessly with VS Code and other external editors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Built-in Editor Limitation**: Internal script editor still saves as LF (help wanted!)

## üöÄ Installation

Rest of the instructions have been given in the [Releases](../../releases) page.

## üéØ Use Cases

Perfect for teams that:
- Use legacy Windows build scripts requiring CRLF
- Have CI/CD pipelines expecting Windows line endings
- Work with Windows-specific file processing tools
- Need consistent line endings across Windows development environments

## üêõ Known Issues

## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.
